				<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">— Professor Slytherin's opinion on the running of Hogwarts</p>
				<div class="bunga"><p>Hogwarts was founded around 990 A.D. by four of the greatest wizards and witches of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They each represented an aspect of personality that they wanted to bring out in new students. However, shortly after founding the school, Slytherin had a falling out with the other founders about blood purity, and wanted to admit only pure-blood students. He felt pure-blooded students deserved to learn magic, and those of other ancestry such as Muggle-borns and Half-bloods, were unworthy. The other three founders all disagreed, especially Gryffindor. Slytherin left the school, but not before secretly building the Chamber of Secrets. He foretold that only his own heir would be able to open it once they arrived at the school, and the heir would unleash a murderous basilisk living inside to purge the school of all Muggle-born students.</p>

				<h1><b>Middle History</b></h1>
				<hr>
				<p>About three hundred years after the school was founded, the Triwizard Tournament was established as an interscholastic competition between three of the most prestigious magical schools in Europe: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons (France), and Durmstrang (An undetermined Northern European country). This tournament was considered the best way for wizards and witches of different nationalities to meet and socialise. The tournament continued for six centuries, until the death toll became too high. The tournament was discontinued until 1994.</p>

				<p>During the 1700s, there was a proposal to install an elaborate plumbing system in the castle. This threatened the secrecy of the Chamber of Secrets, forcing Corvinus Gaunt, a Slytherin student, descendant of Salazar Slytherin and Parselmouth, to protect the entrance to the Chamber by having it concealed behind plumbing fixtures and sinks in second floor girls' bathroom, so only future heirs of Slytherin would know how to open the Chamber.</p>

				<p><h4>1920s</h4></p>
				<p>On 29 November 1926, the Daily Prophet reported that security had to be increased at Hogwarts in response to the growing threat of Gellert Grindelwald's impact on the Global wizarding war. Measures included Headmaster Armando Dippet holding an emergency meeting with worried parents and students being sent home early.</p>
				<p>Both Torquil Travers and Newton Scamander came here in 1927 to seek out the current Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Albus Dumbledore</p>
				<div>
					<img src="Daily Prophet 29Nov1926.png" style="float: right;" />
				</div>
				<h4>1942–1943 school year</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><i>"Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and it’ll look suspicious if I know too much about it. But I know one thing — last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it’s a matter of time before one of them’s killed this time.... I hope it’s Granger"</i></p>
				<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">— Draco Malfoy discussing the first opening of the Chamber of Secrets</p>
				<p>The existence of the school was threatened twice when the Chamber of Secrets was opened. The first time it was opened was in 1942, when Tom Marvolo Riddle, the Heir of Slytherin and the man who would become Lord Voldemort, opened the Chamber in his fifth year.</p>
				<div>
					<img src="myrtle body.jpg" style="float: left;" alt="Myrtle's body being removed from school grounds" />
				</div>
				<p>When a girl named Myrtle Warren was killed, the Ministry of Magic threatened to close the school. As Riddle spent his time away from Hogwarts in a Muggle orphanage, he did not want the school closed. His request to remain in school over the holidays was denied due to the situation he created. Upset with himself, he framed Rubeus Hagrid, and although Albus Dumbledore still suspected Riddle, Hagrid was expelled, and Riddle got off without punishment. However, in 1992, the Chamber was reopened, and it was discovered that Hagrid was innocent and Riddle was guilty.</p>
				<h4>1970s and early 1980s</h4>
				<p>Throughout the entirety of the First Wizarding War, which lasted for eleven long years and caused much distress among the students, Hogwarts Castle was perhaps the only safe haven in wizarding Britain, due to the presence of Albus Dumbledore. Dumbledore had risen to the post of Headmaster, and was the only one whom Voldemort was ever afraid of</p>
				<p>During that time, Snape, Lupin, Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew, as well as Lily Potter and James Potter attended Hogwarts and four of them were part of the Infamous Marauders, who often bullied Snape all the time, until they graduated in 1978.</p>
				<div>
					<img src="mauraders.jpg" style="float: right;" alt="The Marauders in the 1970s" />
				</div>
				<p>While war waged outside the ancient walls of the school and it remained safe from Dark Forces outside the castle, the existence of ancient threats hidden deep within it began to stir when a student by the name of Jacob became intrigued with and began to search for the fabled Cursed Vaults, five secret rooms of ambiguous origins somewhere within the castle said to house ancient magical treasures older even than the school itself.</p>
				<p>Perhaps inspired by the verification of the existence of the Chamber of Secrets, a few decades earlier, Jacob grew increasingly obsessed with his quest to prove the existence of the Cursed Vaults throughout his school career and broke several school rules in his effort to locate them. The situation escalated further as when the pupil finally found it, he examined the outer chamber leading to the vault and, as a result of tampering with magic he did not understand, he inadvertently unleashed a curse that threatened to encase the entire castle in ice, injuring several students in the process.</p>
				<p>By that point, Jacob's quests for the vaults were no secret. Rumours began spreading among the student body that he unleashed several curses upon the school, and even was cursed himself and that he eventually went mad. Ultimately, however, Jacob managed to break into the vault itself, causing the ice to vanish. Despite his part in ending the threat, however, he was found to have endangered the school, as he unleashed the threat in the first place. Jacob's resultant expulsion from Hogwarts was covered in the <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Daily_Prophet"><i>Daily Prophet.</i></a></p>
				<p>With the cursed ice gone from the halls of Hogwarts and his students once more safe from it, Dumbledore and the rest of the school staff did their best to dim the rumours that Jacob had actually located one of the vaults, treating it as an isolated incident that had more to do with Jacob's search for the Cursed Vaults rather than the vaults themselves. They hoped to discourage others from looking for them and maintain the common view that they were just a myth. This worked so effectively that while people still spoke of it a long time afterwards, no one, not even Jacob's <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Jacob%27s_mother"><i>own mother</i></a>, believed that the Cursed Vaults actually existed</p>
				<p>By the end of the 1970s, Lord Voldemort's ascendancy was almost complete. While the Ministry of Magic did their best to both put up a fight and keep wizardkind a secret, a true resistance to him was being concentrated in the underground organisation founded by Dumbledore himself called the <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix"><i>Order of the Phoenix</i></a>. Several former students at the school went on to join the order. On Hallowe'en of the 1981–1982 school year, news would have reached the school of the fall of Lord Voldemort and his failed attempt at murdering the infant Harry Potter, after which students and staff alike would have celebrated the fall of the Dark Lord.</p>
				<h4>Late 1980s</h4>
				<p>However, it was not long before the effects of the <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Cursed_Vaults"><i>Cursed Vaults</i></a> resurfaced around Hogwarts. It first started with the <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Cursed_ice"><i>cursed ice</i></a> reappearing in Hogwarts castle during the 1984–1985 school year. By that time, Jacob's younger sibling had enrolled, and it took two years for they and their friends to locate and break into the Vault of Ice and stop the ice from further spreading. The rest of the Cursed Vaults had subsequently all been tampered with, contaminating the school respectively with <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Boggart"><i>Boggarts</i></a>, the <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Sleepwalking_curse"><i>sleepwalking curse</i></a> and the <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Portrait_curse"><i>portrait curse</i></a>, but thanks to Jacob's sibling and their continually-growing circle of friends, the next three Vaults were successfully infiltrated in three consecutive school years.</p>
				<div>
						<img src="Buried Vault.jpg" style="float: left;"> 
				</div>
				<p>During this time, it was gradually revealed that a secret dark organisation known as R existed and had also been trying to find the Cursed Vaults for the supposed treasures. At the start of Jacob's sibling's fourth year, the 1987–1988 school year, <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Patricia_Rakepick"><i>Patricia Rakepick</i></a> arrived at Hogwarts apparently to help <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore"><i>Albus Dumbledore</i></a> deal with the Cursed Vaults, while in fact being a Dark Witch from R who sought to continue her unfinished business with the Vaults. She became the <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts"><i>Defence Against the Dark Arts professor</i></a> the next year and trained several students, including Jacob's sibling, to be her curse-breaking assistants. Arriving again outside the Buried Vault, she revealed her true nature to the students and attempted to go in before them, but was <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Garrotting_Gas"><i>magically choked</i></a> by Jacob's sibling and fled.</p>
				<p>Rakepick's ability to teach students to defend against the Dark Arts, ironically, turned out to have been a lot more competent than the professor who succeeded her in the next school year. With Dumbledore's permission, the fresh graduate Bill Weasley returned to the school to teach this subject after regular classes. During the school year, yet another curse spread around Hogwarts, continuing to Petrify students, indicating the activity of the final Cursed Vault. While working towards investigating R, the students encountered Rakepick in the Forest Grove, who attempted to kill Ben Copper, leading to the sacrifice of Rowan Khanna. The school staff held a memorial service and suspended the lessons, and the tragedy prompted the vengeful Jacob's sibling, Ben Copper and Merula Snyde to form a secret organisation of their own, the Circle of Khanna, to fight R and race them in locating the final Cursed Vault. It was found to be under the Great Lake, and they had a final showdown with Rakepick outside. She was once again defeated before Jacob's sibling decided to seal the Vault for good to prevent the ancient statue curse from being unleashed again.</p>

				<div>
					<img src="golden trio.jpg" style="float: left;">
				</div>
				<p>In 1991, <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Potter"><i>Harry Potter</i></a> began his career as a student at Hogwarts. Already famous for being believed to be responsible for vanquishing Lord Voldemort at the age of one, he soon began, with the help of his friends <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Ronald_Weasley"><i>Ron Weasley</i></a> and <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hermione_Granger"><i>Hermione Granger</i></a>, to unravel the secret of the Philosopher's Stone being kept at the school. Harry discovered that the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor, <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell"><i>Quirinus Quirrell</i></a>, was a host body for the barely-alive Voldemort, who wanted to use the Stone to restore himself back to his former glory and gain everlasting life.</p>
				<p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione suffered a series of difficult challenges down in the <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Underground_Chambers"><i>Underground Chambers</i></a>, in an attempt to stop the Philosopher's Stone being stolen by Severus Snape. The three believed Snape was trying to steal the stone, when in reality, Quirrell was. Harry discovered Quirrell in the chambers and was able to defeat him, thwarting Voldemort in his attempt to get the Stone and restoring his body. Harry managed this after realising that Quirrell's skin burned whenever he made contact with Harry. Dumbledore stated that Lily's self sacrifice left a mark of love in Harry and that Quirrell was so full of hatred, greed, and ambition that he could not bear to touch a person marked by something so good</p>
				<h4>1992–1993 school year</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">"<i>THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE.</i>"</p>

				<div>
					<img src="ginny.png" style="float: left;" />
				</div>
				<p>In 1992, the Chamber of Secrets was re-opened by Ron's younger sister Ginny, under the influence of a diary written by Tom Riddle. The diary allowed Riddle's memory to possess Ginny and act through her to open the Chamber for a second time.</p>
				<p>Desiring to see Lord Voldemort return to power, <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy">Lucius Malfoy</a> had slipped the diary into her bundle of school books, taking advantage of her ignorance that it was a Horcrux. His ulterior motive was to ruin the reputations of several great wizards, including Dumbledore and the Weasley children's father Arthur Weasley, the latter of whom played a big role in the enactment of the Muggle Protection Act. However, Harry discovered the truth and destroyed the diary and the basilisk, thus bringing an end to these dark plots.</p>
				<h4>1993–1994 school year</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">"<i>As you will all be aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presently playing host to some of the Dementors of Azkaban, who are here on Ministry of Magic business. They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds, and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission</i>"</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">— Albus Dumbledore announcing the presence of Dementors at Hogwarts in 1993</p>
				<p>In 1993, Harry's notorious godfather, Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban. Sirius had been convicted of murdering twelve Muggles and Peter Pettigrew with the Blasting Curse. He also betrayed James, Lily, and Harry Potter's whereabouts to Voldemort in his duty as their Secret-Keeper. Because of the charges against him, he spent twelve years in a high-security cell in Azkaban. The Ministry of Magic also believed that Black was after Harry, as they heard Black murmur "he's at Hogwarts" in his sleep. As a result, Black was thought to believe that killing Harry would bring Voldemort back to full power.</p>
				<div>
					<img src="sirius black.png" style="float: right;" />
				</div>
				<div>
				<p>Black broke into the school twice: one time almost ripping the Fat Lady to shreds, and another time getting close to Ron's "rat," Scabbers. During the second break-in, Ron awoke, which resulted in him screaming in fright, as Black loomed over him with a knife. His screams woke the whole tower and alerted McGonagall to the incident. After this incident, security measures were further heightened. Harry, Ron, and Hermione met Black in the Shrieking Shack, along with Remus Lupin. Lupin had been a friend of Black as well as Harry's parents and Pettigrew during the time they attended Hogwarts as a students</p>
				<div>
					<img src="hermione buckbeak.png" style="float: left;" />
				</div>
				<p>Black revealed the truth to them. He was innocent, and it was Pettigrew who had done the things Sirius had been convicted of. To frame Sirius, he had chopped off one of his fingers as a red herring, turned into his Animagus form (the rat, Scabbers), and scurried off. Sirius had come back to kill Pettigrew, and now that Lupin had heard his story, he believed him and set out to help.</p>
				<p>However, Harry persuaded them to give Pettigrew to the Ministry and let the Dementors have him. As they took Pettigrew back to the castle, Pettigrew escaped and returned to Voldemort to help him return to power. With the use of a time-turner, Harry and Hermione later helped Sirius escape on Buckbeak the Hippogriff while Ron was in the Hospital Wing, saving both Sirius' and Buckbeak's lives.</p>
				<h4>1994–1995 school year</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">"<i>As I was saying, we are to have the honour of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event that has not been held for over a century. It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year.</i>"</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">— Albus Dumbledore introducing the Triwizard Tournament in 1994</p>
				<div>
					<img src="yule ball.png" style="float: right;">
				</div>
				<p>In 1994, Hogwarts played host to the infamous Triwizard Tournament, this time with more powerful safety measures in place. It had been many years since the last tournament had been held, but in the light of the advent of advanced safety measures, the tournament was deemed ‘safe‘. However, more dark plots were being hatched. Barty Crouch Jnr, disguised as Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, managed to enter Harry in the Tournament by putting his name in the Goblet of Fire under the name of a fourth school, which ensured he would be chosen by the Goblet.</p>
				<p>Harry's forced involvement in this plot caused him great misery at Hogwarts, as the representatives for Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, as well as many Hogwarts students, believed he hoodwinked the goblet and entered himself in the tournament. It was because of Crouch Jnr and his influence over certain house-elves that Harry ended up surviving until the end of the tournament and reaching the goal of the Third Task, along with fellow Hogwarts student Cedric Diggory. On Voldemort's orders, Diggory was killed by Pettigrew, and Harry was surrounded by Death Eaters in Little Hangleton Graveyard. Voldemort was brought back to his physical form using Harry's blood and the Resurrection Stone.</p>
				<div>
					<img src="memorial cedric.png" style="float: left;" />
				</div>
				<p>Voldemort attempted to torture and humiliate Harry by means of the Unforgivable Curses. He used the Cruciatus Curse twice on Harry and the Imperius Curse once; Harry was able to resist the latter. Harry escaped and succeeded in alerting all of Voldemort's enemies, Dumbledore in particular, that he had returned. Dumbledore reestablished the Order of the Phoenix one hour after he was alerted. However, many, including Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, chose not to believe him.</p>
				<h4>1995–1996 school year</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">"<i>We have had two changes in staffing this year. We are very pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures lessons; we are also delighted to introduce Professor Umbridge, our new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.</i>"</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">— Albus Dumbledore announcing teaching changes at the school in 1995</p>
				<div>
					<img src="umbridge.jpg" style="float: right;" />
				</div>
				<p>Hogwarts was further threatened when the Ministry of Magic began implementing "Educational Decrees" in 1995, as part of a conspiracy to discredit and ruin Dumbledore and Harry. Dolores Umbridge, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher and Minister Fudge's Undersecretary, was the centre of this plan. By way of these Educational Decrees, she slowly took control of Hogwarts, eventually replacing Dumbledore as Headmistress. However, it was through the cunning of Hermione and the other members of Dumbledore's Army, which was founded by her, Ron, and Harry, that Umbridge was overthrown. The Ministry had no choice but to accept that Voldemort had returned. Umbridge was then removed from Hogwarts and Dumbledore was reinstated.</p>
				<h4>1996–1997 school year</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">"<i>The lightning-struck tower. Calamity. Disaster. Coming nearer all the time.</i>"</p>

					<img src="dark mark.jpg" style="float: left;" />
				</div>
				<p>Through the 1996-1997 school year, the new Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour ordered Aurors to guard Hogwarts for protection from Dark forces, along with the castle's defences being fortified in many ways. In 1997, Hogwarts was attacked by a mob of Death Eaters. Lucius Malfoy's son Draco was forced into the service of Lord Voldemort for fear of his and his family's lives. As a result, Headmaster Dumbledore's safety was compromised, and he was killed by Severus Snape, in a secret coup de grace arranged in advance between them. Following this "horrible" tragedy, Professor Minerva McGonagall was appointed acting Headmistress, though the security of the school hung by a thread. There was no certainty that Hogwarts would remain open. The faculty agreed to follow "established procedures" and let the school governors ultimately decide what to do. Throughout the year students were taken out of school by their families for safety and fear reasons, such as Eloise Midgen and Hannah Abbott, while two of Draco's botched attempts to assassinate Dumbledore ended up dangerously harming Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley, which only served in increasing the anxiety in the atmosphere. However, when Draco succeeded in allowing the Death Eaters entrance, the full effect came to be when many parents rushed their children home, fearing that even Hogwarts, reputably the safest location in the wizarding world, was no longer safe from Voldemort.</p>
				<h4>1997–1998 school year</h4>
				<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">"<i>Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and wizardry, was today appointed Headmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at the ancient school. Following the resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.</i>"</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">— Lord Voldemort takes indirect control of Hogwarts</p>
				<div>
					<img src="snape.jpg" style="float: right;" />
				</div>
				<p>Regardless of the school governors' decision, with the takeover of the Ministry by Voldemort, attendance at Hogwarts was mandatory for all eligible children. New, militaristic requirements were established, such as requiring students to provide proof of Blood status. This enabled Voldemort to keep an eye on the entire wizarding world from a young age and identify muggle-borns, including eleven-year old children who have no knowledge of their magical nature before their forced identification. Such youngsters faced the possibility of never entering Hogwarts nor returning to their homes ever again.</p>
				<p>Academic instruction at Hogwarts became corrupted. Muggle Studies became a required subject, and instruction in it took a new tack with an anti-Muggle bias, while Defence Against the Dark Arts had simply become Dark Arts. Students were taught illegal curses outright, with older students being instructed to practise curses on underclassmen. Snape was appointed Headmaster, and Alecto and Amycus Carrow, teachers of Muggle Studies and Dark Arts, respectively, had been assigned as his deputies.

				<div>
					<img src="2nd war.png" style="float: left;" />
				</div>
				<p>In May 1998, the Battle of Hogwarts took place as one of its most infamous alumni, Tom Riddle, better known by then as Lord Voldemort, returned to attack the school and subdue or destroy its defenders. Voldemort claimed he had no desire to harm the school or its students, but he and his Death Eaters spared no one who opposed them and recklessly damaged the school during their assault.</p>
				<p>Numerous students, staff, parents, graduates, and friends of Hogwarts rose to the school's defence in its hour of need, including the notorious poltergeist Peeves. Thanks to Harry Potter, Lord Voldemort was permanently destroyed and his Death Eaters disbanded forever. Minerva McGonagall became the Headmistress of the school. Harry was celebrated as a true hero.</p>
				<p>Hogwarts sustained extensive damage during the battle. Multiple areas of the main building and adjacent areas were set on fire or blown up, and the Quidditch pitch was largely destroyed by fire.</p>
				<p>After the battle, Hogwarts was repaired. Some students, such as Hermione Granger, returned to the school in 1998 to complete their education. By 2017, normal school life had resumed with McGonagall still as Headmistress and Hagrid still as Keeper of the Keys. Many descendants of previous students were now coming to Hogwarts as new pupils, and Neville Longbottom became the Professor for Herbology after retiring as an Auror.</p>

				</div>
				<p>Term began on 1 September. Students usually reached Hogwarts via the Hogwarts Express, which left Platform 9¾ of London's King's Cross Station at 11 a.m. sharp. There seemed to be other ways of entering the school, such as via broomsticks or Floo Powder, or simply Apparating to a nearby location such as Hogsmeade. Missing the Hogwarts Express for any reason was a very serious problem, but would not cost the student points as long as they got there before the term had officially started. The Hogwarts Express brought the students to Hogsmeade station. First years traditionally crossed the Black Lake in boats with the gamekeeper, travelling under an opening in the rocks upon which Hogwarts was built, through a curtain of ivy, and finally into an underground harbour.</p>
				<p>Older students travelled on the road in carriages pulled by Thestrals (invisible to any that haven't witnessed death) to the castle. The Welcoming Feast took place in the Great Hall. This feast included the Sorting ceremony, followed by a few words from the current Headmaster or Headmistress. The banquet started after this, including large quantities of food and drink. The feast was closed with a few more words from the Headmaster or headmistress, including the usual "start-of-term notices".</p>
				<div>
					<img src="gryffindor commond.jpg" style="float: left;" />
				</div>
				<p>After dinner, students were led to their house common room by a prefect. This was a special time for new students to get comfortable with their surroundings, because the next day classes would begin. The class schedules were handed out during breakfast by the Heads of House. After two weeks of classes, the Quidditch team trials and flying lessons for the first years usually occured.</p>
				<p>Homework was usually assigned to students at the end of classes or at the end of the school term. It was usually completed by students in the: Study Hall, Study Area, Library, Gryffindor Tower reading room or another common room. A homework planner could be used to help students to keep track of all their homework assignments. Some magical planners also told the students to complete the homework when it was opened. If a student failed to complete the homework or was late in handing it in, they could be given a detention as a punishment.</p>
				<p>Hogwarts' school year was structured in a similar way to other non-magical schools and colleges in the UK, with a three-term year punctuated by holidays at Christmas and Easter and bounded by the long summer holiday of nine weeks. Students had the option of staying at Hogwarts for the winter and spring holidays. Those who chose to stay at the castle during the Christmas holidays did not have lessons and attended a feast on Christmas Day. Students also did not have classes the week of Easter, but this was much less enjoyable due to the large amount of work the teachers usually assigned students at this time in preparation for final exams.</p>
				<div>
					<img src="hogsmeade.png" style="float: right;" />
				</div>
				<p>Other than the breaks and weekends, students did not receive holidays. However, students third year and above were allowed to visit Hogsmeade, the local village, occasionally. There were normally four feasts per year: the start-of-term feast at the beginning of the school year, end-of-term feast at the end of the school year, and feasts at Hallowe'en and Christmas. Feasts were also called to mark special occasions, as was seen in the Goblet of Fire book, when there was a feast to celebrate the beginning of the Triwizard Tournament.</p>
				<div>
					<img src="hallowe'en.png" style="float: left;" />
				</div>
				<p>Classes would proceed normally and the next notable event occurs on the evening of 31 October: the Hallowe'en feast. Decorations included giant pumpkins and flocks of hundreds of bats flying across the halls. The served foods included pumpkin treats, tarts, cakes and all sorts of magical sweets. The Quidditch season started usually with the first Quidditch match in the first weeks of November. In the second week of December, the Deputy Head would take names of those who would stay at Hogwarts over the Christmas holidays. The first term usually ended about a week before Christmas, and most of the students and some of the teachers went home by the school train.</p>
				<p>In the Triwizard Tournament years, the Yule Ball occurred on the evening of Christmas Day, ending at midnight. On the 25th of December, a Christmas Feast was held in the Great Hall. Shortly after the 6th January (Epiphany aka Twelfth Night), the Hogwarts Express returned to Hogsmeade; the second term would begin. The exact dates of the beginning of the Easter holidays varied every year. During these holidays, the students could go home. The final exams were held the first week of June and the results came out on the second week. In the evening before the Hogwarts Express went back to London, the End-of-Term Feast was held. The Hogwarts Express returned to London during the third week of June. Some staff and all of the students left Hogwarts for summer holidays.</p>

				<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">— Albus Dumbledore explaining the rules of Hogwarts to a young Tom Riddle</p>
				<p>Hogwarts' motto was: "Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus", translated as: Never tickle a sleeping dragon. Quidditch was possibly the most popular sport at the school, with most of the student body turning out to watch each match. Hogwarts also had a Frog Choir which sang at special occasions.</p>

				<p>The blazon of the Hogwarts Coat of Arms clockwise from top left: the Gryffindor lion, the Slytherin serpent, the Ravenclaw eagle, and the Hufflepuff badger, all circling the letter 'H'. The motto, "draco dormiens nunquam titillandus", carried in an escroll beneath the shield. The way that the house mascots are arranged makes the centre line divide the houses with warm colours and mammalian mascots from the houses with cold colours and saurian mascots.</p>
				<h4>School Song</h4>
				<p>There was an official school song, though it was only sung when the headmaster was in a particularly good mood and deemed it appropriate (which is therefore why it was only known to have been commissioned once from 1991-1998). It didn't seem to conform to the strict opinions of older headmasters and headmistresses, such as Armando Dippet. As such it may have been an invention of the relaxed Albus Dumbledore, and certainly sounded like it was of his invention. There was no standard rhythm to the song. Everyone could sing it how they like, as such the Weasley twins preferred a slow and deep style. The lyrics are shown below:</p>
				<br><i>"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,</i></br>
				<br><i>Teach us something please,</i></br>
				<br><i>Whether we be old and bald,</i></br>
				<br><i>Or young with scabby knees,</i></br>
				<br><i>Our heads could do with filling,</i></br>
				<br><i>With some interesting stuff,</i></br>
				<br><i>For now they're bare and full of air,</i></br>
				<br><i>Dead flies and bits of fluff,</i></br>
				<br><i>So teach us things worth knowing,</i></br>
				<br><i>Bring back what we've forgot,</i></br>
				<br><i>Just do your best, we'll do the rest,</i></br>
				<br><i>And learn until our brains all rot</i></br>

					<h1><b>House Ghost</b></h1>
				</div>
				<hr>
				<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">"<i>A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth.</i>"</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">— Professor Severus Snape</p>
				<div>
					<img src="hogwarts ghost.jpg" style="float: right;" alt="House ghosts (left to right): Bloody Baron, Fat Friar, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, and Helena Ravenclaw" />
				</div>
				<p>Hogwarts was the most heavily haunted dwelling place in Britain (and this was against stiff competition, as there were more reported ghost sightings/sensings on these damp islands than anywhere else in the world). The castle was a congenial place for ghosts, because the living inhabitants treated their dead friends with tolerance and even affection, no matter how many times they had heard the same old reminiscences. Each of the four Hogwarts houses had its own ghost.</p>
				<p>Slytherin boasted the Bloody Baron, who was covered in silver bloodstains. He was well known for being extremely unsocial and many students, including those of his own House, were known to be slightly afraid of him. While alive, he was a hot-tempered man. The least talkative of the house ghosts was the Grey Lady, who was long-haired and beautiful. She was the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, making her the only house ghost who was directly related to one of the four Hogwarts founders</p>
				<p>Hufflepuff house was haunted by the Fat Friar, who was executed because senior churchmen grew suspicious of his ability to cure the pox merely by poking peasants with a stick, and his ill-advised habit of pulling rabbits out of the communion cup. Though a genial character in general, the Fat Friar still resented the fact that he was never made a cardinal. He also frequently suggested that Peeves be given a second chance, whether or not he deserved it.</p>
				<div>
					<img src="moaning myrtle.png" style="float: left;" alt="Moaning Myrtle" width="150" height="200" />
				</div>
				<p>Gryffindor house was home to Nearly Headless Nick, who in life was Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington. Something of a snob, and a less accomplished wizard than he believed, Sir Nicholas lounged around the court of Henry VII in life, until his foolish attempt to beautify a lady-in-waiting by magic caused the unfortunate woman to sprout tusks. Sir Nicholas was stripped of his wand and inexpertly executed, leaving his head hanging off by a single flap of skin and sinew. His ghost retained a feeling of inadequacy with regard to truly headless ghosts.</p>
				<p>Another notable Hogwarts ghost was Moaning Myrtle, who haunted an unpopular girls' toilet. Myrtle was a student at Hogwarts when she died, and she chose to return to school in perpetuity, with the short-term aim of haunting her arch-rival and bully, Olive Hornby. As the decades rolled by, Myrtle had made a name for herself as the most miserable ghost in school, and was usually found to be lurking inside one of the toilets and filling the tiled space with her moans and howls.</p>
